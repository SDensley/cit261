                The HTML warrior began a transformative journey through the internet.
                He encountered a rotation transform that made it hard to see so he turned back.
                He found what looked like a cool color pallet but was really contrasting.
                After fixing his color he ran into a border.
                Luckily, he found a way to escape that border.
                But in escaping he began to fade.
                To avoid fading entirely he ran back to where he started.
