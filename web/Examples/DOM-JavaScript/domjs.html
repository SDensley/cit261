    <h1>DOM Manipulation Example</h1>
    <div>
        <p>This page is similar to the Local Storge example page and the JSON and AJAX example page. The differences 
           here is that the way the data is populated onto the page. The data is populated using DOM Manipulation 
           instead of adding HTML tags to a string and applying that as the innerHTML of a div tag.</p>
        <p>The page loads automatically and populates with the details about the characters from the game "The Red 
           Dragon Inn: Battle for Greyport," the version they come from, their damage dice for each level, and their 
           abilities for each level. Buttons are also added to each row in the table. If you click on the button that 
           row will be removed fro he table. Below is a button to reset hte tables after deleting the rows.</p>
        <button onclick="restoreTables()">Restore Tables</button>
