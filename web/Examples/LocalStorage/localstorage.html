    <h1>localStorage Example</h1>
    <div>
        <p>This page is similar to the JSON and AJAX example page. The differences here is that the AJAX 
           call will load the JSON file into local storage. Once the file is in local storage the data 
           is accessed from the local storage object.</p>
        <p>Click on the button to display the contents of the localStorage object in a nice user friendly format. 
           This object contains key/value pairs. 
           The data is then sorted to present a table of all the Roles in the Pandemic board game along with 
           the expansion they are from and the abilities associated with that role.</p>
        <button onclick="">Display RDI JSON Content</button>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>You can also select a version and display just the Roles from that version.</p>
