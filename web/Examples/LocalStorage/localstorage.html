    <h1>localStorage Example</h1>
    <div>
        <p>This page is similar to the JSON and AJAX example page. The differences here is that the AJAX 
           call will load the JSON file into local storage. Once the file is in local storage the data 
           is accessed from the local storage object.</p>
        <p>Click on the button to display the contents of the localStorage object in a nice user friendly format. 
           This object contains key/value pairs. The data is then sorted to present a table of all the Roles in the 
           Pandemic board game along with the expansion they are from and the abilities associated with that role.</p>
        <button onclick="displayAll()">Display Pandemic Roles</button>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>You can also select a version and display just the Roles from that version.</p>
        <form id="versionSelect" action="versionSelect" method="post">
            <select id="version" name="version" onchange="versionSelect()">
            </select>
        </form>
    </div>
    <div id="pandemicDisplay"></div>
    <h1>sessionStorage Example</h1>
    <div>
        <p>The following is an example of sessionStorage. The values will increase each time you change the version or 
           click the button to display all versions.</p>
        <p>You have clicked the Display Pandemic Roles button <span id="sessionClick">0</span> times.</p>
        <p>You have changed the version selector <span id="sessionSelect">0</span> times.</p>
        <p>The values will continue to increase until you close the tab and re-open it or reloading the page. In those 
           scenarios, the values will reset to 0.</p>
    </div>
