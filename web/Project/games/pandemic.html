    <h3>Pandemic</h3>
    <p>
        As skilled members of a disease-fighting team, you and the other 
        players work together to keep the world safe from outbreaks and 
        epidemics. Only through teamwork will you have a chance to find 
        a cure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pandemic is a cooperative board game in which players work as a team 
        to treat infections around the world while gathering resources for 
        cures. First published in 2007, the game's unique combination of 
        cooperative gameplay, engrossing premise, and compelling design have 
        proved a hit with everyone from hardcore gamers to casual players. 
        The Pandemic game line now includes multiple expansions and 
        stand-alone titles.
    </p>
    <h3>The Red Dragon Inn</h3>
    <p>
        You and your adventuring companions have spent all day slogging 
        through the Dungeon, killing monsters and taking their stuff. Now 
        you're back in town, healed up, cleaned up, and ready to party at the 
        Red Dragon Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
        Drink, gamble, and roughhouse with your friends. But don't forget to 
        keep an eye on your Gold. If you run out, you'll have to spend the 
        night in the stables. Oh... and try not to get too beaten up or too 
        drunk. If you black out, your friends will continue the party without 
        you... after they loot your body for Gold of course!
    </p>
    <p>
        The last conscious adventurer with Gold wins the game!
    </p>
    <h3>The Red Dragon Inn: Battle for Greyprot</h3>
    <p>
        The city of Greyport is nestled between ocean to the east and 
        imposing, nearly impassible cliffs to the west. You and your 
        adventuring companions are just returning to the bustling city of 
        Greyport after your latest adventure. You are all looking forward to 
        relaxing and spending some of your hard-earned loot at The Red Dragon 
        Inn. The party will have to wait, though, because the city is under 
        attack by evil monsters!
    </p>
    <p>
        Battle for Greyport is a cooperative deckbuilding game based on the 
        characters and world of The Red Dragon Inn. You will travel to 
        important locations around the city, fighting epic battles and 
        recruiting whatever heroes and items you can along the way. Each 
        encounter presents more opportunities to improve your deck, but also 
        brings more dire foes for you to face!
    </p>
    <p>
        With five playable characters, seven different scenarios, and an 
        assortment of variants, you can have a new game every time, adjusting 
        the game’s difficulty as you improve.
    </p>
    <p>
        Will you defend the city from the monsters and defeat their nefarious 
        boss, or will the city (and the tavern!) be overrun?
    </p>
    <h3>Smash Up</h3>
    <p>
        Smash Up, designed by Paul Peterson, is the Shufflebuilding game from 
        Alderac Entertainment Group.  In Smash Up players draft two faction 
        decks, such as pirates, ninja, robots, zombies, and more, and combine 
        them into a force to be reckoned with!
    </p>
    <p>
        When the game begins, players take turns drafting one of several 
        faction decks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once each player has two decks, they shuffle them together, combining 
        their distinct abilities into a unique 40-card deck.
    </p>
    <p>
        A random selection of Base cards are dealt to the table, and players 
        use their decks to attempt to have the most power on a base when it 
        is scored.
    </p>
    <p>
        It may sound simple, but how simple is it when the Zombie-Ninja deck
        Assassinates your minions then creates an Outbreak, loading the Base
        with minions from their discard pile?
    </p>
    <p>
        Or when the Pirate-Dinosaurs Full Sail onto the base with the mighty 
        King Rex, whose massive power dwarfs that of other minions?
    </p>
    <p>
        Each combination gives a different experience, Pirate-Aliens play very 
        different than Pirate-Zombies, and with 8 factions in the base set 
        there are 64 combinations to try out and every expansion set increases 
        the options exponentially!
